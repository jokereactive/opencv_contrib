ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* CMakeLists.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => openCVSamplefacedetection/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* jni/ => openCVSamplefacedetection/src/main/jni/
* res/ => openCVSamplefacedetection/src/main/res/
* src/ => openCVSamplefacedetection/src/main/java/
* src/.DS_Store => openCVSamplefacedetection/src/main/resources/.DS_Store
* src/org/.DS_Store => openCVSamplefacedetection/src/main/resources/org/.DS_Store
* src/org/opencv/.DS_Store => openCVSamplefacedetection/src/main/resources/org/opencv/.DS_Store
* src/org/opencv/samples/.DS_Store => openCVSamplefacedetection/src/main/resources/org/opencv/samples/.DS_Store
* src/org/opencv/samples/facedetect/.DS_Store => openCVSamplefacedetection/src/main/resources/org/opencv/samples/facedetect/.DS_Store
* src/org/opencv/samples/facedetect/export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=:User:Sarthak:Library:Andr => openCVSamplefacedetection/src/main/resources/org/opencv/samples/facedetect/export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=:User:Sarthak:Library:Andr

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
